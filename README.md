## Benjamin Arthur Stuart

After graduating with a degree in Mathematics and successfully completing Makers Academy (a high intensity 12 week software development bootcamp), I am more than ready to begin my career. I have grown from writing basic applications in Visual Basic at college, to becoming a confident full-stack developer with an appreciation for test driven development, agile and pair programming. My ability to learn quickly coupled with my logical thinking led  me to comfortably understand and use these principles to maintain high code quality. However my ultimate drive for writing good code is my love for problem solving; whether it’s fixing bicycles from a young age, solving Rubik's cubes or building a gaming computer, I will learn anything to get that final working result. This mindset led me to explore the world of software development. 

## Projects

| Project   | Description | Technologies | Testing |
|---        |---         |---           |--- |
| [Crawl](https://github.com/Ben230/Crawl) | A pub crawl planning app | React, Next.js, MongoDB | Jest + Enzyme, Cypress |
| [MakersBnB](https://github.com/Ben230/makersbnb) | An AirBnB clone - allowing hosts to list spaces and users to make bookings | Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL | Rspec, Capybara |

## Skills

- **Fast learner** - In my [final project](https://github.com/Ben230/crawl) at Makers, we chose to use React, Next.js, and Google APIs. No one in my team had experience in either of the three and we had a deadline of two weeks. But we managed to create a usable pub crawl app due to our persistence (and patience).
- **Team player** - I fit into a team naturally; I am able to follow instructions but can also show leadership. During the Air BnB project, I hosted standups and guided the team for that day. 
- **Logical thinker** - Being a fan of maths since I can remember, this isn’t surprising. I have methodological approaches to life in general; coding is my favourite thing to do in my spare time.
- **Organised** - Recording my progress helps me learn. I made extensive notes from lectures at university, making sure I covered every corner of all the modules. I also created [daily goals](https://docdro.id/ZcmAJCs) at Makers which helped me reflect on my learning.
- **Effectively handle blockers** - This is the main thing I took away from studying at Makers. When you run into a problem you can’t solve quickly, make sure you keep a calm head and follow a logical debugging process.
- **Creative** - I used to drum in a couple of bands and I can play the piano. I feel my creativity trickles down to my code whenever it can. For example, in the final project I really pressed for an  ‘open in gmaps’ feature that was praised by my team after the presentations.
- **Thrive under pressure** - At the beginning of Makers, the thought of presenting to 150 people in 12 weeks was extremely daunting for someone that knew very little about programming and presenting. Nevertheless, this drove me to excel in creating our product and showcasing it to an audience.
